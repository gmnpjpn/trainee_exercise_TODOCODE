## Statement 📄

Assume a seating reservation system for an amphitheater. The theater has 10 rows of 10 seats each.\
It is necessary to develop a system (without using a database, only logical data handling) that allows to carry out the following:\
1. Load the "map" of rows and seats. Indicating with an "X" the occupied seats and with an "L" the free seats.\
When starting the program, all seats must be free.

2. Handle the seat reservation considering that a seat CAN ONLY BE RESERVED if it is in "L" status, in case it is in "X" status, the buyer must be allowed to choose another seat.\
If it is in status "L", it must automatically change to status "X".

3. To finalize the program, a particular value must be entered. Consider that there is no exact number of times the program can be executed.

4. Be aware that there are ONLY 10 ROWS AND 10 SEATS. You cannot sell seats outside of these numbers.\
No "overselling" is allowed.

## Observations 👁️

* No GUI or DB implementation is required. The logical management of the application development will be evaluated 100%.

* In case a client requests to visualize which are the free seats, the system must allow to show graphically the seat map. Do not use GUI for this case.

* Use ONLY logic and console output.
